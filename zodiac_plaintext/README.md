The idea here is to gather all of the Zodiac's letters (both those investigators are certain from
him and also those they suspect might be him) so that the characteristics of those letters can be
used to solve the ciphertexts.

- Examples:
  - we can create a dictionary of the words used in his
letters and look for those words first in his ciphertexts.
  - we can use the frequency distribution of alphabet letters across these documents to get a
  potentially-more-accurate sense of the likely frequency distribution of alphabet letters in his
  ciphertexts.
